# hdlib
This is my private library containing some base classes and util classes I use in my private projects.
Feel free to use that library, but be aware that things may change at any time in the future to fit my personal needs.

# Changelog
The changelog can be found in the [release section](https://github.com/sockeqwe/hdlib/releases)

# Proguard
This library itself doesn't need any specific proguard rules.
However, third party libraries that are integrated in mosby like [Butterknife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/), [FragmentArgs](https://github.com/sockeqwe/fragmentargs), [Icepick](https://github.com/frankiesardo/icepick) and (optional) [dagger 1](http://square.github.io/dagger/) may have there own proguard rules. Please visit these projects site.
